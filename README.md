The application is called Follow Up, and it’s a call reminder app. It is meant to be an app for the company to have a way to schedule their client calls and improve their daily work life. The app allows the user to add contacts to the app, which will typically contain name, phone number, and email (optional), and they can use the reminder selection mode to select the date and time of their first reminder, and the frequency of the reminder as daily, weekly, monthly, and every 3 months. After the reminder has been set, the app will send a notification to the user whenever the reminder is supposed to occur. There is also an option to remove contacts and/or reminders in case they are unnecessary. That is a brief overview of the its functionality.
